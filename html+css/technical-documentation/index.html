      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:<p><ul><li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li><li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).

    <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
      <header><h1>Hello world</h1></header><p>
      To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:<p>
      <div class="code"><code>function greetMe(yourName) { 
        alert("Hello " + yourName); 
        }
        greetMe("World");</code></div>
    </section>
    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header><h1>Variables</h1></header><p>
      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
<p>
  A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

    <section id="Declaring_variables" class="main-section">
      <header><h1>Declaring variables</h1></header><p>
      You can declare a variable in three ways:<p>
With the keyword var. For example,<p>
       <div class="code"><code>var x = 42.
         </code></div> <p>
      This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example,
<p>
      <div class="code"><code>x = 42.</code></div><p>
  This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<p>
      With the keyword let. For example,<p>
      <div class="code"><code> let y = 13.</code></div>
